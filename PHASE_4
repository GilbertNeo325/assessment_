 PHASE 3: Migrations & Applying to SQL Server
          🧠 You should run all commands in the Server project folder (where AppDbContext is)

🔧 Step 1: Install EF Core Tools (if not already installed)
If you’re using Visual Studio Code + CLI, run this in the terminal:

        dotnet tool install --global dotnet-ef

📥 Step 2: Install EF Core NuGet Packages in the Server Project
Run the following commands in your Server project folder:

        dotnet add package Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.SqlServer
        dotnet add package Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.Tools


🛠️ Step 3: Add Initial Migration
From inside your Server folder, run:

        dotnet ef migrations add InitialCreate

✅ You should see output showing that migration files were created in a new Migrations folder.

📤 Step 4: Apply Migration to Your SQL Server DB
Still inside the Server folder, run:

      dotnet ef database update

🎉 This creates the tables in the SEESA_ASSESSMENT database in SQL Server (SSMS).
